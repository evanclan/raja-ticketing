# Events Visibility Fix

## Problem
Admin-created events are not showing up in the "Available Events" section of the User Dashboard, even though they are successfully created.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. RLS Policy Issue
The current database setup has this RLS policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active events" ON events
  FOR SELECT USING (status = 'active');
```

This policy allows **unauthenticated (public)** users to view active events, but there's no explicit policy for **authenticated** users. This means when a logged-in user tries to fetch events, they don't have permission.

### 2. Missing Event Status Filter
The UserDashboard was fetching events without filtering by `status = 'active'`, which could cause issues even with the correct RLS policy.

## Solution

### 1. Database Fix (SQL Script)
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add policy for authenticated users to view active events
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view active events" ON events
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (status = 'active');
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (Already Applied)
Updated `src/components/User/UserDashboard.jsx` to:
- Explicitly filter for `status = 'active'` events
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot
- Improved error handling

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Before
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("events")
  .select("*")
  .gte("event_date", now)
  .order("event_date", { ascending: true });

// After  
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("events")
  .select("*")
  .eq("status", "active") // Only fetch active events
  .gte("event_date", now)
  .order("event_date", { ascending: true });
```

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `fix-events-visibility.sql`
4. Verify the policy was created successfully

### Step 2: Test Event Visibility
1. **As Admin:**
   - Create a test event (it should be created with `status = 'active'`)
   - Verify the event appears in the admin event list

2. **As User:**
   - Log into User Dashboard
   - Check the "Available Events" section
   - Events should now be visible

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
With the debug logging added, you can check the browser console for:
- "Fetched events: [...]" - Shows what events were retrieved from database
- "Filtered available events: [...]" - Shows events after filtering out already-registered ones
- Any error messages

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For New Users:
- All active, future events should appear in "Available Events" section
- Users can click on events to see details and register

### For Users with Existing Registrations:
- **Approved Events**: Show in "Approved Events" section with QR ticket option
- **Pending Events**: Show in "Pending Approval" section
- **Available Events**: Show remaining events user hasn't registered for
- **Past Events**: Show in "Past Participated Events" section

## Files Modified
1. **`src/components/User/UserDashboard.jsx`** - Added status filter and debug logging
2. **`fix-events-visibility.sql`** - Database RLS policy fix

## Database Policies Summary
After applying the fix, the events table will have these RLS policies:

1. **"Admins can manage all events"** - Admins can CRUD all events
2. **"Public can view active events"** - Unauthenticated users can view active events
3. **"Authenticated users can view active events"** - âœ¨ NEW: Logged-in users can view active events

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Events still not showing
**Check:**
1. Verify the SQL policy was applied successfully
2. Check if events have `status = 'active'` in the database
3. Check if event dates are in the future
4. Look at browser console for error messages

### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Solution:**
- Make sure the RLS policy was created correctly
- Verify user is properly authenticated
- Check if the policy name conflicts with existing policies

### Issue: Events showing for some users but not others
**Check:**
- User authentication status
- RLS policies are applied correctly
- Clear browser cache/cookies and re-login

## Debug Commands

### Check Events in Database (Admin/Supabase Dashboard):
```sql
SELECT id, title, event_date, status, created_at 
FROM events 
WHERE status = 'active' 
AND event_date >= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY event_date ASC;
```

### Check RLS Policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'events';
```

## Additional Notes

- Events are automatically created with `status = 'active'` by the CreateEventForm
- The fix maintains security by only showing active events to users
- Debug logging will be removed in production builds
- This fix is backward compatible with existing events and users
