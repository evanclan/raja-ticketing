## 🚦 Current App Context (as of July 2024)

### Core Features Implemented

- User registration and authentication (Supabase Auth)
- Persistent login/session management (with proper logout)
- Admin dashboard for event management (create, edit, delete, activate/deactivate)
- Superuser dashboard for admin/user management (add/delete admins, view all users)
- Event creation with rich details (date, time, location, price, capacity, images, etc.)
- Row Level Security (RLS) and policies for secure data access
- User dashboard:
  - List of past participated events
  - List of upcoming events
  - View event details and participate in upcoming events
- Event participation system (registrations table, RLS policies)
- Admin can view participants for each event (modal with user emails)
- Role-based dashboard routing (only admins see admin dashboard, users see user dashboard)
- Duplicate event key bug fixed in user dashboard
- All session and role bugs fixed (no auto-admin, no auto-login after logout)

### Database Schema

- `auth.users` (Supabase default)
- `events` (all event details)
- `registrations` (user_id, event_id, created_at)
- `superusers` (for master admin)

### Security

- RLS enabled on all tables
- Policies for insert/select on registrations
- Only authenticated users can participate in events
- Only admins can manage events

### UI/UX

- Clean, modern React UI (inline styles, ready for Tailwind)
- Modals for event details and participants
- Loading and error states everywhere
- No duplicate React keys

### Recent Fixes

- Only users with `role: "admin"` see admin dashboard
- Regular users see a user dashboard
- Proper logout clears Supabase session
- Registration does not grant admin role
- Duplicate event key warning fixed in user dashboard
- Participation logic and event lists are unique and correct

### Next Steps

- Add UserDashboard features: registration status, cancel participation, etc.
- Add event editing for admins
- Add guest/anonymous event viewing (optional)
- Polish UI with Tailwind or design system
- Add analytics/reporting for admins

## 🎉 LATEST SUCCESS: Admin Creation System (Jan 2025)

### ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: Admin Creation Now Works!

**Issue**: The previous admin creation system had a database trigger that was forcing all users to have role "user", even when created as admin.

**Solution**: Implemented a completely new admin creation system:

- **New Endpoint**: `/api/create-proper-admin` (replaced broken `/api/create-admin`)
- **Bypass Strategy**: Direct database insertion + force role update
- **Result**: Successfully creates users with BOTH auth metadata role AND database role set to "admin"

**Technical Details**:

1. Creates auth user with admin metadata
2. Directly inserts into `public.users` with admin role (bypasses trigger)
3. Force updates role after creation to ensure it sticks
4. Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Verification**: Server logs show successful creation with both roles as "admin"

```
[create-proper-admin] FINAL RESULT:
  Auth metadata role: admin
  Public users role: admin
```

## 🎉 LATEST SUCCESS: Participants System Complete! (Jan 2025)

### ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE: Full System Working!

**Completed**: Participants display system now works perfectly!

**Final Solution**:

- **Server-side endpoint**: `/api/event/:eventId/participants` bypasses RLS restrictions
- **Clean participants modal**: Shows approved users with email and name
- **Real-time approval**: Admins approve users → participants list updates
- **Production ready**: All debugging code removed, clean codebase

**Technical Achievement**:
The system now handles the complete flow:

1. Users register for events → Status: "pending"
2. Admins approve via dashboard → Status: "approved"
3. Participants button shows real approved users with names
4. Server-side queries bypass frontend permission restrictions

### 🎯 **System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ✅
