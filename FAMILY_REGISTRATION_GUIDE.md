## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations

- Family member data is fetched only when needed (QR scan, participant view)

- Batch operations for multiple family member lookups

### Future Enhancements (Potential)

- Family member photo uploads
- Individual check-in tracking per family member
- Family-specific event pricing
- Family member-specific ticket types
- Bulk family member import/export

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Family members not showing**: Ensure database migration is applied
2. **QR scanner not showing family**: Check Supabase RLS policies
3. **Family count incorrect**: Use "Refresh" button in Participants modal

### Support:

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection and permissions
- Ensure all database tables and functions are created correctly
